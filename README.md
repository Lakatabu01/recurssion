# Recursion

Recursion is a computer science method with the idea that a function calls itself.
It’s used to take a big problem and start breaking it down into smaller pieces (“Divide and Conquer”) and continuing to feed their solutions back into the original function until some sort of answer is achieved and the whole chain unwinds.

This project is aimed at solving problems using the recursive method
